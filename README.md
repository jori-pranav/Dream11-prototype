   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Integration Between Frontend and Backend

- The Next.js frontend communicates with the Flask backend using RESTful APIs for fetching data and interacting with the machine learning model.
- The backend processes user input, runs predictions using the trained AI model, and returns the results to the frontend.


## Model UI:

The Model-UI is used to run the model between a start and end date for both- Training and Testing for the Dream-11 players and provide the downloadable csv along with the metric visualized using graphs

### Prerequisites
 1. NodeJS should be installed in your local system(Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))
 2. You should have a Account in WanDB for visalizing the graphs and must get a API key. [Click here](https://wandb.ai)
 3. Python must be installed and it's path must be set up in your local system. Download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 4. Set up a .env folder in the same directory as __main__.py. Follow the .env.sample file there


### How to start the Flask Server(this where the model runs)
 1. Create and Start a virtual enviroment in inside the directory where __main__.py exists. follow the below in the terminal
```
python -m venv venv
```
```
venv/Scripts/activate
```
 2.  Set the requriements.txt file by this - 
```
python -m pip install requirements.txt
``` 
 3. Start the Flask server by running the below code in same directory as __main__.py where the virtual enviroment is running(make sure the port 5000 on your localhost is free) 
```
pip __main__.py
```
Now the server is running on localhost:5000


## How to Run the UI Locally

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**  
   Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**  
   After the dependencies are installed, run:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  

4. **Access the UI**  
   - The UI will start on `localhost:3000`.  
   - Ensure that port 3000 is free; otherwise, the application will start on a different port (e.g., 3001).  
   - Check the terminal output to confirm the port being used.  



### User Flow
 Enter the start and end date for the training and testing and click on generate. This will take you to the next page where it takes time to generate the response in the server.
